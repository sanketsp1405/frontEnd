            <p>On a regular basis, you should bring your car in for a car tune up as well as replace consumable items such as motor oil, radiator coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, wiper blades and brake pads. Some vehicles also require mechanical maintenance like replacing spark plugs, drive belts, timing belts or chains, and air and fluid filters.

                Belts and hoses wear out over time. Rubber hoses can crack or swell, which leads to leaks that could leave you stranded. As your car approaches 100,000 miles, a check of hoses for the radiator, power brakes and power steering are a necessity.
                
                Tire Pros offers a range of routine vehicle maintenance services including tune-up services, inspection and replacement of belts and hoses.
                
                Keeping up to date with scheduled maintenance will help your car run more efficiently. Youâ€™ll avoid the potential for expensive damage that could cost a lot more down the road.</p>
