            <td>Shared Vision and Values: Your co-founder should share a common vision for the company's mission and values. Having alignment in your long-term goals and principles is crucial for a harmonious partnership.

                Complementary Skills: Look for someone with skills and expertise that complement your own. A co-founder should bring strengths to the table that balance your weaknesses. For example, if you're a tech-savvy product visionary, a co-founder with strong business development or operational skills can be invaluable.
                
                Commitment and Dedication: Building a company is often a long and challenging journey. Your co-founder should be equally committed to the company's success and willing to put in the necessary time and effort to make it work.
